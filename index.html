					<h3>
						<blue>A</blue>bout
					</h3>
					<p>
						<strong>Cells</strong> is a programming language. From it's code it is more likely to be c<red>a</red>lled as an <strong>Esolang</strong>. That is also true because it might be a bit compl<blue>e</blue>x.<br><br>
						The code is written in <strong>one line</strong>. Technically, one line but in cells. We can also say that one line divid<blue>e</blue>d into multiple segments otherwise multiple lines merged into one line.<br><br>
						Cells is an <strong>open-source</strong> programming <red>l</red><yellow>a</yellow>nguage. It was originally made in <strong>python(3.9)</strong> and within about 200-204 lines ini<blue>t</blue>ially. Cells was created <strong>Attachment Aditya</strong> in the <strong>year 2021, mont<red>h</red> May plus within 3-4 days and progress of 1-3 hours per day</strong>. The records are also pr<yellow>e</yellow>sent in YouTube.<br><br>
						In Cells, biol<red>o</red>gical terms related to cells are majorly used. The segments of the single-line code are cal<blue>l</blue>ed cells and t<yellow>h</yellow>ese cells are divided by colons(":").

						*Any text in square brackets("[]") mean it is the user input and in main code square brackets("[]") are not required. User inputs are in form of "[Name:Type]" here. Other than that data types(text and num) can be represented with variables as well. Anything not inside square brackets("[]") is syntax and is necessary to write.

					<p>
						Main credits goes to <strong>Attachment Aditya</strong>. The original program runs on <strong>python</strong>. A few code editors were us<blue>e</blue>d, <strong>Graviton</strong>(Main Scripting) and <strong>Sublime Text 3</strong>(For Few Final Edits + Web Site). <strong>GitH<yellow>u</yellow>b</strong> was used to establish this page and carry open-source. Distributio<red>n</red>s, Promotions and S<yellow>o</yellow>urces not included, but could be found on the videos published on <strong>You<red>T</red>ube</strong>. No work was done off-camera(Other than handling crashes in OS while coding, it just happened once and i<blue>t</blue> started to hibernate). Special thanks to <strong>Audience</strong> for showing interest.
