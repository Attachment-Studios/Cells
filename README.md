# About
Cells is a programming language. From it's code it is more likely to be called as an Esolang. That is also true because it might be a bit complex.

The code is written in one line. Technically, one line but in cells. We can also say that one line divided into multiple segments otherwise multiple lines merged into one line.

Cells is an open-source programming language. It was originally made in python(3.9) and within about 200-204 lines initially. Cells was created Attachment Aditya in the year 2021, month May plus within 3-4 days and progress of 1-3 hours per day. The records are also present in YouTube.

In Cells, biological terms related to cells are majorly used. The segments of the single-line code are called cells and these cells are divided by colons(":").

# Examples
- Hello, Cells
  - ::: `exocytosis Hello, Cells!!!:`
- Species(Variables)
  - ::: `nomenclate myVar < 10:exocytosis myVar:`
- Truth Machine
  - ::: `exocytosis Truth Machine:nomenclate inp < 0:endocytosis inp:skip inp:regulate ^ 7:regulate ^ 9:exocytosis 0:>:exocytosis 1:regulate ^ 9:`

# Credits
Main credits goes to Attachment Aditya. The original program runs on python. A few code editors were used, Graviton(Main Scripting) and Sublime Text 3(For Few Final Edits + Web Site). GitHub was used to establish this page and carry open-source. Distributions, Promotions and Sources not included, but could be found on the videos published on YouTube. No work was done off-camera(Other than handling crashes in OS while coding, it just happened once and it started to hibernate). Special thanks to Audience for showing interest.
